## Dotfiles dotfiles, my dotfiles

Info on dotfiles : http://dotfiles.github.com/

Feel free to use my files if they are of any interest to you. Dotfiles as of now
is a total mess. Use at your own risk. Will clean up someday when I get time.

If you are looking for my emacs.d, its
[here](https://github.com/jaseemabid/emacs.d)

## Installation

*This will override existing files, you have been warned*

The `Makefile` is a mess, but will do its job. Known issues are listed in the
file as a TODO. Please read the file before continuing.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jaseemabid/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
	$ cd ~/dotfiles
	$ make
